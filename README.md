# ALS Full Stack Developer Exercise 2

## Description

This program uses React to read a JSON file of "user cards". It extracts the information from the JSON file by passing the data down parent components to the child component "Body" using props. It then iterates over the data using the .map() function to display the name, username, phone and email in the table.

## Installation

To use this program, simply clone the repo and load the HTML file into your client.
